## Hi👋, I'm Diasha 

🤖 **Robotics & AI Graduate**  
🧠 **Machine Learning | Artificial Intelligence | LLMs**  
🔍 Actively seeking **Graduate Opportunities** | Open to **PhD positions**

## 🌟 About Me
I’m a Robotics and Artificial Intelligence graduate with a strong passion for **Machine Learning, AI systems, and intelligent robotics**. I enjoy building data-driven solutions, experimenting with modern ML techniques, and exploring how AI can be applied to real-world problems.

I’ve worked on multiple **machine learning projects**, continuously expanding my knowledge in areas such as **model development, evaluation, and deployment**. Recently, I’ve been diving deeper into **Large Language Models (LLMs)** and learning how to integrate them into practical applications.

Alongside ML and AI, I’m currently strengthening my skills in **Docker** and **AWS**, with a focus on building scalable and production-ready systems.

I’m actively looking for **graduate-level roles** where I can contribute, learn, and grow — and I’m also very open to pursuing a **PhD** in AI, or Machine Learning.
